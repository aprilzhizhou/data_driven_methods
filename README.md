# data_driven_methods

Projects include:
1. using **cross convergent mapping (CCM) test** to detect causality in various dynamic systems and performing sensitivity analysis to the delay time and the dimension of the manifold embedding
2. studying the information transport in 1D lattices of uni-directionally coupled maps using **transfer entropy**
3. testing **dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm** on data from the nonlinear schrodinger equation and the vorticity field for fluids flow past a cylinder 
4. testing the performances of **the Granger causality test** and **the cross convergent mapping (CCM) test** on time series data  
5. testing **the SINDy model selection algorithm** on various infectious disease models
