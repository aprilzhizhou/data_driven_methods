In this project, we test the SINDy model selection algorithm on a variety of infectious disease models (SIR) with constant transmission rates, noisy transmission rates, and decreasing transmission rates. 
We also collect data on the reported COVID-19 infection, recovery and death in Hubei province, China, and use SINDy to constract a model for the disease spreading process.
